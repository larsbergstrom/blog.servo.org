### Planning and Status

Our overall [roadmap](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap) and [quarterly goals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JMOtVkRtb-s7auoQdnX810HGglkMK054LTXOo0_rdrU/pub) are available online.

This week's status updates are [here](http://statusupdates.dev.mozaws.net/project/servo).
